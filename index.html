    <p>"Fire Island National Seashore was established in 1964 to preserve the only developed barrier island in the
        United States without roads."</p>
    <p>Fire Island is a secluded, slim island standing between the Atlantic Ocean and Great South Bay. While there, we
        were able to expreience the peaceful yet powerful nature of this land.</p>
    <p>The haven is consdiered a boater's paradise. With plenty of rental programs available, we had no trouble getting
        a few jet skis to take out for a day.
        Beach combing was next on our bucketlist- as there are stretches of beach as far as the eye can see, there was
        plenty room to hone our inner pirate and search for hidden treasure.
        The last activity to make up our adventure was hiking. After spending so much time on or next to the water, we
        had to get inland and see the views from a different perspective.</p>
